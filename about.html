      <h2>The heart behind this space</h2>
      <p>Whispers in the Pew was born from a journey that began in early loss and grew into steady pursuit. 
        A young boy lost his mother at thirteen and continued walking into a small church where wooden pews, 
        familiar faces, and extended family became shelter. Two younger sisters watched closely, 
        and faith slowly moved from surrounding influence to personal conviction. Grief could have closed the heart. 
        Hunger opened the heart instead.</p>
      <p>A humble mother once prayed faithfully. A father walked a different road. 
        Church became more than a building during those years. Church became family. 
        Aunts, cousins, and friends formed a covering that carried three children through seasons no child should face alone. Within that covering, 
        a deeper question began to form. Who is Jesus to me?</p>
      <blockquote>Whispers in the Pew exists for calm worship and focused listening.</blockquote>
      <p>Whispers in the Pew exists to honor quiet pursuit. Calm worship and focused listening grew from wooden benches, 
        soft hymns, and long moments of reflection after services ended. Faith that once felt inherited became embraced through seeking. 
        Scripture moved from familiarity into revelation. John 14:18 became more than words on a page. 
        “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” settled deeply and personally. Comfort was not described as an idea. 
        Comfort was described as His presence. That promise carried weight through every season.</p>
      <p>This book exists to serve those who sit quietly in sanctuaries and hunger for something deeper than routine. 
        Devotions here aim for warmth without weakness, clarity without harshness, 
        and reverence anchored in the truth that God is one and His name is Jesus. Each reflection flows from lived experience, 
        not theory. Each page reflects a life shaped by family, loss, responsibility, and steady pursuit of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Whispers in the Pew stands as testimony that faith can grow strong in humble places. 
        Faith can become personal even when childhood changes quickly. Faith can remain steady when revelation takes root. 
        A borrowed flame flickers. A chosen flame burns steady.</p>
      <p>This work exists to guide readers toward that steady flame.</p>
