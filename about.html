      <h2>The heart behind this space</h2>
      <p>Whispers in the Pew was born from a journey that began in early loss and grew into steady pursuit. A young boy lost his mother at thirteen and continued walking into a small church where wooden pews, familiar faces, and extended family became shelter. Two younger sisters watched closely, and faith slowly moved from surrounding influence to personal conviction. Grief could have closed the heart. Hunger opened the heart instead.</p>
      <p>A humble mother once prayed faithfully. A father walked a different road. Church became more than a building during those years. Church became family. Aunts, cousins, and friends formed a covering that carried three children through seasons no child should face alone. Within that covering, a deeper question began to form. Who is Jesus to me?</p>
