      <p><b>Devotion:</b></p>
      <p>We’ve all heard the phrase “mind over matter,” often used to push through physical pain, 
        ignore distractions, or summon strength from within, 
        but the biblical version isn’t about mustering willpower or positive thinking. 
        It’s about surrendering our minds to God and allowing His truth to reshape our perspective. 
        The world tells us to trust ourselves. God tells us to trust Him.</p>
      <pre><i>Renewing the Mind</i></pre>
<pre>Romans 12:2 reminds us: “Do not be conformed to this world… 
  but be transformed by the renewal of your mind.” 
  This renewal is not a one-time event, but a daily, intentional resetting of our thoughts. 
  God doesn’t want us to be shaped by the world’s distractions, fear, and pressure. 
  Instead, He calls us to be shaped by His Word, His truth, His promises, His ways.<pre>
      <li><i>Faith Over Flesh</i>
        <li>2 Corinthians 10:5 gives us a weapon: we have divine authority to 
          “take every thought captive.” We don’t fight mind battles alone. 
          When thoughts of doubt, fear, or insecurity creep in, we don’t just 
          “think positive.” We bring those thoughts to the feet of Jesus and say, 
          “Not my will, but Yours be done.”</li>
      <li><i>Divine Alignment</i></li>
      <li>God doesn’t expect us to figure everything out. Isaiah 55:8 says, 
        “For My thoughts are not your thoughts…” His wisdom is higher, deeper, and better than ours. 
        That’s why we trust. That’s why we surrender. 
        That’s why we realign our thoughts with His Word, even when we don’t understand everything.</li>
      <li><i>Peace in the Process</i></li>
      <li>Jesus tells us in Matthew 6:25 not to worry. 
        Why? Because when our minds are set on Him, peace begins to rule. 
        We realize we are not in control, but we are in the hands of the One who is. 
        And that is enough.</li>
      <li><b>Prayer:</b></li>
<li>Lord, help me not to rely on my own strength or understanding. 
  Teach me to renew my mind daily with Your truth. 
  Let my thoughts reflect Your Word and my heart be filled with Your peace. 
  I surrender my thinking to You. Let me live from a mind that is set on things above, not on what surrounds me. 
  In Jesus’ name, amen.</li>
