      <p><b>Devotion:</b></p>
      <p>In our fast-paced world, we crave instant results. 
        We want quick answers, overnight success, and quick fixes. 
        God doesn’t work that way. He’s a God of process.
        Growth takes time, healing takes time, and character is shaped over seasons, not seconds.</p>
      <p>When you feel stuck or discouraged, remember this: God is still working. 
      Even when you can’t see it, He’s shaping you, pruning you, and preparing you for what’s ahead. 
        The process might feel slow, even painful, but it’s not pointless. Every step matter to Him.</p>
      <blockquote>Philippians 1:6 reminds us that the work God started in us isn’t abandoned. 
        He’s not finished with you yet. The delays, the detours, the waiting; 
        they’re all part of the process He’s using to mature your faith and align you with His purpose.</blockquote>
      <p>Trusting the process means trusting the One behind it. He sees the full picture. 
        And in His hands, nothing is wasted.</p>
      <p><b>Reflection Questions:</b></p>
<p>1. What part of the process are you struggling to trust right now?</p>
<p>2. How has God used past seasons of waiting or hardship for your growth?</p>
<p>3. What truth from His Word can you cling to in the waiting?</p>
      <p><b>Prayer:</b></p>
<p>Lord, I admit I often grow impatient with the process. 
  Help me to trust You even when I don’t understand the timing. 
  Remind me that You are at work in every season, and You will finish what You started in me. 
  Strengthen my heart to wait with faith and expectation. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
