      <p><b>Devotion:</b></p>
      <blockquote>Jeremiah was young and afraid when God called him to speak (Jeremiah 1:6-8). 
        He didn’t feel qualified. He was overwhelmed.</blockquote>
      <p>Maybe you’ve felt the same way when it comes to sharing your faith:
“What if they judge me?”, “What if I say the wrong thing?”, “What if they reject me?”</p>
      <p>God chose Jeremiah, fully aware of his youth and fear, and in that choosing, 
        He promised to provide everything he would need to carry out the mission.</p>
      <p>When we witness, it’s not about having perfect words or a fearless attitude. 
        It’s about trusting that God will speak through us. 
        Fear doesn’t mean you’re failing, it means you’re stepping out of your comfort zone. 
        That’s often where God works best. </p>
      <p>The Lord promises to be with you, to guide your words, and to soften hearts. 
        You don’t need to be a preacher. 
        Just be willing. Share what God has done for you. Be honest. Be kind. Leave the rest to Him.</p>
<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
<p>•	What makes you most nervous about witnessing? </p>
<p>•	Can you think of someone in your life who needs encouragement or hope? </p>
      <p>•	Ask God today to give you one small opportunity to share His love, with words or actions.</p>
      <p><b>Prayer:</b></p>
<p>Lord, I want to be a light for You but sometimes fear holds me back. 
  Remind me, Lord, that I don’t have to be perfectly willing. 
  Speak through me. Help me to trust that You will give me the right words, 
  and that even small steps of faith matter. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
