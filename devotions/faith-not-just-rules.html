      <p><b>Devotion:</b></p>
      <p>Many people wonder what it takes to get to heaven. 
        Is it following every church rule? Is it perfect? 
        The Bible gives us a freeing and beautiful answer: it’s grace.</p>
      <p>We don’t earn our way to heaven through rule-keeping. 
        If that were the case, none of us could make it. 
        Instead, God offers salvation as a gift; received through faith in Jesus Christ. 
        He came not to start a religion full of rules, but to restore relationship with us.
        This doesn’t mean that how we live doesn’t matter. Love, kindness, 
        humility, and obedience naturally flow from a heart that’s been changed by grace. 
        Those things are the fruit, not the root of salvation.</p>
      <p>God is not asking for our perfection; He’s asking for our trust.</p>
      <p><b>Prayer:</b></p>
<p>Father, thank You for saving me by grace and not by works. 
  Help me to stop striving for Your love and simply receive it. 
  Grow in me a deeper faith and a life that honors You, not because I have to, 
  but because I love You. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
