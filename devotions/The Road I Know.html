      <p>There’s something powerful about remembering where your journey with God began. For many of us, it wasn’t in a sanctuary filled with applause, but in quiet, unassuming moments where we had no choice but to trust Him.</p>
      <p>I remember feeling God’s presence most deeply when I was young and vulnerable, yet full of raw faith. With no car, no covering, and sometimes no clarity, I would walk to church for miles, through rain, snow, and the blazing summer sun. I didn’t know much about sin or division. I just knew I wanted to be where God was.</p>
      <p>In those early days, obedience came naturally. My heart was unburdened by skepticism, and my spirit was willing. My friend Dallas and I would visit church members, pray with them, and intercede together for those brought before the congregation. We weren’t looking for recognition; we simply wanted to do God’s will. And He met us there, every single time.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until later, when I began asking God for discernment, that I became aware of the spiritual battles happening around me. I started to notice things others overlooked, shifts in the atmosphere, the presence of different spirits, and the quiet warnings from the Holy Spirit. I learned that discernment isn’t just a gift, it’s a responsibility. It means recognizing the difference between truth and deception, light and darkness, </p
      <p>I felt the pull between God’s direction and the world’s distractions. Isaiah 30:21 became so real to me, even before I fully understood it: “And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, ‘This is the way, walk ye in it,’ when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.”</p>
      <blockquote>There were moments when I did not know which way to go, yet deep down I could still hear God’s whisper pointing me toward His path. Proverbs 22:6 also rang true in my life: “Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.”</blockquote>
      <p>Even though my family could not always understand the depth of what I was sensing or chasing after, the Word was taking root inside of me. I had been taught many things growing up, but not all of it matched the truth of Scripture. For a long time, I repeated what others said because it sounded right. Eventually, I began searching in Scripture for myself. What I found there changed me. It brought freedom, it anchored me, and it became the voice I knew I could always follow.</p>
      <p>You may feel alone at times in your pursuit of God, especially when others don’t understand your fire. But know this: the Lord sustains those who seek Him sincerely. Setbacks, misunderstandings, and even silence are not signs that you have failed. They are part of refining. God is not looking for performance. He is after your obedience.</p>
      <p>So, keep walking the road you know, the one where His voice still whispers, “This is the way,” even when it feels unfamiliar, even when it feels lonely, and even when it costs you something. He will meet you there, just as He always has for me.</p>
      <p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
<p>Have you ever felt God’s presence so strongly that it carried you through confusion, hardship, or even misunderstanding?</p>

<p>You’re not alone, and through your journey and testimony, you may help someone else find their way.
</p>
<p>Let’s walk it out together. This is the way. Walk in it.
