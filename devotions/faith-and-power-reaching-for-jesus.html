      <p><b>Devotion:</b></p>
      <p>The woman with the issue of blood had every reason to give up. 
        Twelve years of suffering, shame, and failed remedies had taken everything from her health, 
        her money, her place in society. But she heard about Jesus. She heard something powerful: faith (Romans 10:17). </p>
      <p>Despite her weakness and fear, she reached out, 
        believing that even touching the hem of His garment would be enough. 
        That’s Hebrews 11:1 in action, faith as the substance of her hope, 
        the proof of a healing she hadn’t yet seen. And Jesus honored it. </p>
      <p>In that moment, her quiet act of faith drew power from Christ Himself (Mark 5:30). 
        Just as Matthew 21:22 promises, her believing heart received what it sought. 
        Jesus stopped, turned to her, and called her “Daughter” restoring not just her body, but her dignity. </p>
      <p>What changed her life wasn’t simply the touch, it was the faith behind it. 
        And the Jesus who healed her is still the same today (Hebrews 13:8). 
        When we reach out to Him in faith, especially in our most desperate moments; 
        we tap into the same power that restored her.</p>
      <p><b>Prayer:</b></p>
<p>Lord, give me the courage of that woman, 
  to believe when all seems lost, to reach out when I feel unworthy, 
  and to trust that You are enough. May my faith be active, real, 
  and rooted in Your unchanging power. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
