      <p>There was a time when faith surrounded my life, 
        yet faith had not fully settled within my heart. 
        Church felt familiar, hymns felt comforting, and scripture sounded strong, 
        yet something deeper stirred inside me. Familiar surroundings could not satisfy a growing hunger. 
        A quiet desire formed within my spirit to know Jesus personally, 
        not through memory alone, not through tradition alone, not through someone else’s experience.</p>
      <p>Grief reshaped childhood earlier than expected, 
        and responsibility matured awareness faster than comfort would have allowed. 
        Even with family nearby and a church that embraced and protected, 
        a deeper question remained steady in my heart. Who is Jesus to me? 
        That question moved beyond curiosity and became pursuit.</p>
      <p>I remember sitting in a wooden pew beneath warm sanctuary light, 
        listening with a different kind of attention. Words carried weight that day. 
        Scripture did not feel distant. Prayer did not feel rehearsed. Hunger replaced routine, 
        and seeking replaced simple attendance. Faith was no longer something I stood around. 
        Faith was becoming something I stepped into.</p>
      <blockquote>In that season of searching, one verse began to settle deeply within me. 
        Jesus said, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” John 14:18. 
        Those words did not sound like poetry alone. Those words sounded like promise. 
        They spoke directly into loss, directly into questions, directly into the quiet spaces that no one else could fill. 
        Comfort was not described as an idea. Comfort was described as His presence. He did not promise distance. 
        He promised that He Himself would come.</blockquote>
      <p>That promise changed everything. Jesus was not a distant figure to admire. 
        Jesus was present. Jesus was near. 
        The same One who carried my family through difficult seasons was willing to reveal Himself personally to me. 
        Revelation did not arrive through noise or spectacle. 
        Revelation grew through steady seeking, quiet prayer, 
        and sincere desire to understand who He truly is.</p>
      <p>A difference exists between growing up around faith and growing into faith. 
        Surrounding faith can comfort, yet personal faith sustains. 
        Surrounding faith can inspire, yet personal faith endures. 
        Personal faith forms when hunger meets revelation and pursuit meets presence. 
        Faith became mine when I stopped leaning only on what I had heard and began pursuing what He was speaking to me.</p>
      <p>Understanding deepened as I embraced the truth that God is one and His name is Jesus. 
        That truth moved from doctrine into experience. 
        Prayer carried weight. Worship carried meaning. 
        Scripture carried clarity. Faith was no longer inherited. Faith was embraced.</p>
      <blockquote>A borrowed flame flickers when winds rise, yet a personal flame holds steady through storms. 
        Faith became mine when desire to know Jesus outweighed comfort of familiarity. 
        Faith became mine when pursuit replaced assumption. 
        Faith became mine when the promise of John 14:18 became real in my own life and I understood that He had not left me comfortless. 
        He had come near.</blockquote>
      <p>Steady faith does not appear overnight. 
        Steady faith grows through seasons of seeking. 
        Each quiet moment in the sanctuary, each whispered prayer, 
        each scripture read with sincerity shaped a foundation that could not be shaken.</p>
      <p>Faith became mine, and once rooted deeply in the name of Jesus, 
        peace followed with strength that carried forward into every season.</p>
