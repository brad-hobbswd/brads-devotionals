      <p><b>Devotion:</b></p>
      <p>Have you ever heard the phrase “mind over matter”? 
        Well, the Bible has a deeper meaning for it. 
        It’s not just about having willpower; it’s about thinking differently. 
        The battles we fight every day, anxiety, doubt, temptation, and discouragement; are often won or lost in our minds.</p>
      <p>Paul reminds us in Romans 12:2 that transformation starts with our minds. 
        That means thinking like God’s truth, not the world’s noise. 
        When fear says, “You can’t,” God’s Word says, “You can do all things through Christ.” 
        When pain says, “You’re broken,” truth says, “You are made new.” <p>
      <p>Faith isn’t about ignoring reality; 
        it’s about choosing to believe that God’s reality is bigger than what we see or feel. 
        It’s mind over matter; 
        choosing God’s promises over our problems, His peace over our panic. </p>
      <p>You might not be able to change your circumstances today, 
        but you can change how you think about them. And that change can change everything. </p>
      <p><b>Reflection Questions</b></p>
<p>1. What thoughts have been shaping your attitude or decisions lately? </p>
<p>2. Are those thoughts based on God’s truth or the world’s patterns? </p>
<p>3. What truth from Scripture do you need to start saying over your life today? </p>
      <p><b>Prayer:</b></p>
<p>God, renew my mind today. 
  Help me see lies and replace them with Your truth. 
  Give me the strength to choose faith over fear, peace over stress, and hope over despair. 
  Let my thoughts be shaped by You, not by the world. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
