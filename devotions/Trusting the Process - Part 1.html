      <p><b>Devotion:</b></p>
<p>Trusting the process with God isn’t just a nice phrase, 
  it’s a declaration of faith in His perfect plan. The path may be unfamiliar. 
  The steps may seem unclear. The destination is already secured in Christ. 
  For those who belong to Him, the end result is glory. Jesus has already paid the price. 
  He has already declared you holy. 
  Now, your walk is simply catching up with what’s already finished.</p>
      <p><b>Reflection:</b>
<p>Let’s be honest, trusting the process sounds good until life starts throwing curveballs. 
  When relationships feel strained, doors close unexpectedly, or the silence of waiting becomes loud. 
  The process can feel like punishment, but the truth is that God’s process is always purposeful.</p>
      <p>You may not see what He’s doing, and you may not understand why it’s happening; He’s still moving. 
        Behind the confusion and beyond the pain, He’s working all things together for your good (Romans 8:28). 
        That isn’t a cliché; it’s a covenant.</p>
      <p><b>Here’s how to trust God’s process in real life:</b>
1. Faith: Believe in God’s goodness even when life feels anything but good. He’s not absent. He’s active.
2. Acceptance: Life isn’t just about the destination; it’s about the journey. The detours and delays are part of His divine direction.
3. Surrender: Let go of the need to control outcomes. Trust that the One who created the stars knows how to order your steps.
4. Peace in Uncertainty: Peace isn’t found in having all the answers; it’s found in knowing Who holds the future in His hands.
 </p
      <b>I felt the pull between God’s direction and the world’s distractions. Isaiah 30:21 became so real to me, even before I fully understood it: “And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, ‘This is the way, walk ye in it,’ when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.”</b>
      <blockquote>There were moments when I did not know which way to go, yet deep down I could still hear God’s whisper pointing me toward His path. Proverbs 22:6 also rang true in my life: “Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.”</blockquote>
      <p>Even though my family could not always understand the depth of what I was sensing or chasing after, the Word was taking root inside of me. I had been taught many things growing up, but not all of it matched the truth of Scripture. For a long time, I repeated what others said because it sounded right. Eventually, I began searching in Scripture for myself. What I found there changed me. It brought freedom, it anchored me, and it became the voice I knew I could always follow.</p>
      <p>You may feel alone at times in your pursuit of God, especially when others don’t understand your fire. But know this: the Lord sustains those who seek Him sincerely. Setbacks, misunderstandings, and even silence are not signs that you have failed. They are part of refining. God is not looking for performance. He is after your obedience.</p>
      <p>So, keep walking the road you know, the one where His voice still whispers, “This is the way,” even when it feels unfamiliar, even when it feels lonely, and even when it costs you something. He will meet you there, just as He always has for me.</p>
      <p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
<p>Have you ever felt God’s presence so strongly that it carried you through confusion, hardship, or even misunderstanding?</p>

<p>You’re not alone, and through your journey and testimony, you may help someone else find their way.
</p>
<p>Let’s walk it out together. This is the way. Walk in it.
