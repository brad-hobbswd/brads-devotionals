      <p><b>Devotion:</b></p>
<p>Trusting the process with God isn’t just a nice phrase, 
  it’s a declaration of faith in His perfect plan. The path may be unfamiliar. 
  The steps may seem unclear. The destination is already secured in Christ. 
  For those who belong to Him, the end result is glory. Jesus has already paid the price. 
  He has already declared you holy. 
  Now, your walk is simply catching up with what’s already finished.</p>
      <p><b>Reflection:</b>
<p>Let’s be honest, trusting the process sounds good until life starts throwing curveballs. 
  When relationships feel strained, doors close unexpectedly, or the silence of waiting becomes loud. 
  The process can feel like punishment, but the truth is that God’s process is always purposeful.</p>
      <p>You may not see what He’s doing, and you may not understand why it’s happening; He’s still moving. 
        Behind the confusion and beyond the pain, He’s working all things together for your good (Romans 8:28). 
        That isn’t a cliché; it’s a covenant.</p>
      <p><b>Here’s how to trust God’s process in real life:</b></p>
<li>1. <u>Faith:</u> Believe in God’s goodness even when life feels anything but good. He’s not absent. He’s active.</li>
<li>2. <u>Acceptance:</u> Life isn’t just about the destination; it’s about the journey. The detours and delays are part of His divine direction.</li>
<li>3. <u>Surrender:</u> Let go of the need to control outcomes. Trust that the One who created the stars knows how to order your steps.</li>
<li>4. Peace in Uncertainty: Peace isn’t found in having all the answers; it’s found in knowing Who holds the future in His hands.</li>
 </p
      <p><b>Let’s Get Real:</p></b>
<p>ometimes, we struggle to trust the process because we struggle to trust ourselves. We think, “What if I mess this up?” or “What if this never gets better?” That kind of fear is rooted in self-doubt, not God-doubt. Here’s the truth: even when you’re unsure, God is still sure.
</p>
      <p>When things get overwhelming, it’s often your mind’s way of trying to protect you from the unknown. 
        Instead of leaning into fear, leaning into faith. Instead of giving up, give it over; to the God who never fails.</p>
      <p>Even in love, we tend to give and pour and pray for everyone except ourselves. 
        In trusting the process includes trusting that God loves you, too. He’s working in your heart, not just through your service to others.</p>
      <p><<b>Scripture Reminders:</b></p>
<p>“Love one another with brotherly affection [as members of one family], giving precedence and showing honor to one another.”  Romans 12:10</p>
</p>
      <p>“The greatest among you will be the one who serves others. 
        Anyone who makes themselves important will be made humble, but anyone who stays humble will be lifted up and honored.” Matthew 23:11–12</p>
      <p><b>Prayer:</b></p>
<p>Lord, help me to trust You when I can’t trace You. When the process feels heavy, remind me that You’re not finished yet. 
  Teach me to release control, accept the journey, and walk in faith. Thank You for perfecting me even as I’m being made holy. 
  I surrender to Your timing, Your will, and Your purpose. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
