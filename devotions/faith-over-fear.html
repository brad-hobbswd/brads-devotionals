      <p><b>Devotion:</b></p>
      <p>Fear often tries to hold us back with lies; telling us we’re not good enough, that we’ll mess up, or that danger is everywhere. Faith speaks louder! Faith reminds us that God is with us, and He’s stronger than anything we might face.</p>
      <p>In 2 Timothy 1:7, Paul tells Timothy not to let fear control him, but to embrace the spirit God gave him; one of power, love, and a clear mind. Fear doesn’t come from God; it’s a trick of the enemy to keep us from living our best lives. So, when we trust God’s promises, fear starts to lose its power.<p>
      <p>Faith doesn’t mean we won’t feel scared; it means we choose to trust God even when we do. We walk forward knowing He’s in control, and His perfect love chases away all fear (1 John 4:18).</p>
      
      <p><b>Reflection Questions</b></p>
<p>1. What fears have been holding you back lately?</p>
<p>2. How can you actively choose faith in those situations?</p>
<p>3. What promises from God’s Word can you hold onto today?</p>
      <p><b>Prayer:</b></p>
<p>Father, thank You for being bigger than my fears. Help me to trust You even when I feel anxious or unsure. Fill me with Your peace, power, and love. Remind me that You are always nearby. I choose faith over fear today. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
