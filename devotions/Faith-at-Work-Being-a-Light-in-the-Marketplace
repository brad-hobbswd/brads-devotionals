      <p><b>Devotion:</b></p>
      <p>Faith and hope are like two hands reaching toward heaven: one holding tightly to God in trust, the other reaching forward in expectation. </p>
      <p>Faith is the foundation. It anchors us when nothing around us makes sense. It says, “God is with me, even in the storm.” Faith believes now, even without seeing. It’s not based on how we feel or what we see, it’s based on who God is. </p>
      <p>Hope, on the other hand, lifts our eyes. It reminds us that the pain, the waiting, the uncertainty is not the end of the story. Hope whispers, “There’s more ahead.” It’s the joyful expectation that God’s promises will come to pass. </p>
      <p>In seasons of waiting, we need both. Without faith, we’ll lose our grip. Without hope, we’ll lose our vision. </p>
      <p>When we pray, we exercise faith. When we wait for peace, we live in hope. Both are gifts from God, meant to sustain us, not just in the good times, but especially in the hard ones. </p>
     
      <p><b>Prayer:</b></p>
<p>Lord, strengthen my faith so I can trust You even when I cannot see the way. 
  Fill my heart with hope that I may always look forward to Your promises with joy and peace. 
  Help me to live each day anchored in Your truth and inspired by the future You have prepared for me. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
