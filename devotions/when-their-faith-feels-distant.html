      <p><b>Devotion:</b></p>
      <p>You love someone who says they believe in Jesus, but their life, 
        words, or priorities don’t show a deep relationship with Him. 
        Maybe you’ve invited them into deeper conversations. 
        Maybe you’ve prayed over and over for God to stir their heart. 
        Still, they seem distant, distracted, or uninterested. </p>
      <p>It’s tough not to feel frustrated or even spiritually lonely. 
        You want to share the joy of walking closely with Jesus, 
        but it feels like you’re on different spiritual paths. </p>
      <p>Remember this: God loves them more than you do. 
        He knows every thought, wound, and barrier in their heart. 
        He knows the exact moment that will turn their heart toward Him more fully. 
        Your prayers are not in vain. Your life, even when quiet, is a witness.  </p>
      <p>You don’t have to change them, that’s God’s work. 
        Your job is to keep walking close with Jesus yourself. 
        Shine His love. Stay soft. Keep praying. Their story isn’t over yet.</p>
      <p><b>Reflection Questions:</b></p>
<p>1. How does it feel when your closeness to Jesus isn’t shared by someone you love? </p>
      <p>2. In what ways can you show grace and patience as God works in their life? </p>
      <p>3. What truths remind you to trust God’s timing and not your own?</p>
      
      <p><b>Prayer:</b></p>
      <p>Lord, it hurts to feel distant from someone I care about spiritually. 
        I want them to know You deeply and walk closely with You. Help me be patient, 
        trusting that You are at work even when I can’t see it. Give me peace and help me be a reflection of Your love, 
        not pressure, not control, just grace. In Jesus’ name, amen.</p>

      <h1>Story Time</h1>
      <h2>Waiting at the Edge of the Water</h2>
      <p>Brad stood at the shoreline of the lake, the early morning mist curling around his feet. 
        He loved coming here to pray. The stillness always reminded him that God was near, always listening.</p>
      <p>Brad glanced over his shoulder. Justin was sitting on the bench behind him, 
        scrolling through his phone. He had come with him, not for the same reason. 
        He said he believed in Jesus, but when Brad spoke about quiet time, Scripture, 
        or the things God was doing in his life, Justin only nodded politely, distant, 
        like someone looking through a dark glass.</p>
      <p>Brad used to push, 
“Don’t you want more than this?”
“Don’t you feel like He’s calling you deeper?”
</p>
      <p>It seemed pushing only widened the space between them.
Now, he prayed more and spoke less.
</p>
      <blockquote>As Brad stood by the water, whispering prayers again for his heart,
James 4:8 echoed softly in his spirit: “Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.”
</blockquote>
      <p>Tears welled, not in despair, from trust. 
        Brad knew he could not make Justin step into the water, 
        but he could remain there himself, steady and unmoving. 
        He chose to let his faith ripple out like quiet waves, 
        believing patience was not surrender but confidence. 
        God, he trusted, was already at work in ways he could not yet see.</p>
      <p>He knew this truth, love prays, love waits, 
        and love believes that even distant hearts are never out of God’s reach.</p>
      <p>This reflection, from the devotion When Their Faith Feels Distant, 
        flows from the pen of my heart for every moment when my faith or someone else’s feels far away, 
        as though I am watching from the outside, looking in through a window.</p>
